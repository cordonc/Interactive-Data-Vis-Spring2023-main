    <h1>valentines day?</h1>
    <h2>valentine's day occures every February 14. </h2>
    <h3>In ancient Rome, the Romans' celebrations were violent.</h3>
    <p>From Febrary 13 to 15, Romans celebrated the fest of Lupercalia. The men sacrificed a goat and a dog, then whipped women with hides of the animals they had just slain.
    </p>
    <p>The Roman romantics "were drunk. They were naked," Noel Lenski, now a religious studies professor at Yale University, told NPR in 2011. Young women would line up for the men to hit them, Lenski said. They believed this would make them fertile.</p>
    <p>The brutal fete included a matchmaking lottery in which young men drew the names of women from a jar. The couple would then be, um, coupled up for the duration of the festival — or longer, if the match was right.</p>
    <p>The ancient Romans may also be responsible for the name of our modern day of love. Emperor Claudius II executed two men — both named Valentine — on Feb. 14 of different years in the third century. Their martyrdom was honored by the Catholic Church with the celebration of St. Valentine's Day.</p>
